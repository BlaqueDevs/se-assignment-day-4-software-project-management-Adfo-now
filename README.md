# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met
Timely delivery is crucial because it keeps the project on schedule hence happy customers. This maybe achieved by regular meetings to ensure that everyone is at par and also proper planning and budgeting to avoid delay.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns? 
Cost control manages bugets and prevents cost overrun. Strategies include estimating the cost of resources, materials and equipment and developing a budget plan.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Both are project management methodologies used in software development.
Agile has iterative and incremental approach, emphasizes on flexibility, collaboration and customer feedback 
advantage; quick response to changes, improve team Collaboration 
disadvantages; less predictability, requires significant customer involvement.
Waterfall has a linear and sequential approach, each phase is completed prior to the next one.
advantages; has clear structure and documentation, easy to manage.
disadvantages; difficult to accommodate changes, testing occurs later in the project.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile maybe more beneficial in cases where there's no fixed approach but only a final product is needed e.g a company requires an e-commerce management system with no specifications.
Waterfall maybe beneficial when a project has to have specific things or features in them e.g an e-commerce management system that has specific demands.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
use of standards such as ISO 9001 and capacity maturity model integration. Code reviews and walk throughs as well.
High quality standards ensures that project deliverables meet the required stands and standards and satisfy customer expectations.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
It helps define the project boundaries hence the project seeks to sticks to solve a particular problem and not every problem.
A work breakdown structure is a stucture that aids in work distribution and allocation depending mostly on specialty of the team members.It helps to ensure that work is done efficiently and perfectly.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
 A detailed project schedule helps in monitor the progress of a project and controlling it with reference to the plan.
 Gantt chart provide a visual representation of the project schedule, it integrates scope, schedule and cost performance helping in project monitoring and control.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to address the burnout that is always there whenever students look for course books, lecturers notes and past papers.These problems are significant because a lot of time and money is spent to look for course e-books online, and also having to look into various groups to find different notes are a great source of distraction and time wasting.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
It helps to identify and understand the problem at hand, it helps recognize pain points hence I shall be able to include key features and functionalities that make my solution effective.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
I would first introduce my software solutions to my audience, i would use the current statistics in the school or world to explain to them how the problem is a big deal. I would explain how my software directly addresses the problem at hand e.g it is like walking into a mall that has everything you need, there's no need to traverse elsewhere. It would tell them how it is tome conscious and they may have just more time to boost their gardes to higher without having much distractions.  I 
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Features may include; course feature, unit feature,lecture notes,
course books feature, assignment feature,key concepts feature, past papers feature, games feature, ask co pilot feature.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Data available is that 75% of student struggle with finding their notes, tracking assignments and also looking for books to help them keep up with their studies. This is a ready market and since there are new students yearly, growth is prospected.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
It would help me know what my target audience needs and what are the technological advantages that I need to include so as to make my product to stand out.
